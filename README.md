# Flow_Nodes

This project is a React-based user interface component designed to visually construct and manage conversational flows using a node-based system. Built with React, TypeScript, and React Flow, the NodePalette component provides a structured sidebar (palette) where users can add various types of nodes to their flow diagram and export the resulting configuration.

## Features

- Live Flow Editing: Nodes are added dynamically into a canvas (managed separately), enabling intuitive visual flow building.

- Export Functionality: The current state of the nodes and edges can be exported as a - downloadable JSON file (flow-export.json) for persistence or further processing.

- Theming & Accessibility: Fully supports light/dark themes, keyboard accessibility, and responsive styling using Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.
